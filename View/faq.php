            1.Why can't I login?
            There are several reasons why this could occur.
            First, ensure your username and password are correct.
            If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you haven't been banned.
            It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.

            2. Why do I need to register at all?
            You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order
            to post messages.
            However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as
            definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc.
            It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.

            1. Can I use HTML?
            No. It is not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML.

            2. Can I post images?
            Yes, images can be shown in your posts.
            If the administrator has allowed attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board.
            Otherwise, you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g.
            http://www.example.com/my-picture.gif.
            You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images
            stored behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password protected sites, etc.
            To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag.
